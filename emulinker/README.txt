1.0.2 (05/22/2006)
==================

Almost exactly 1 year after the first beta release, this is the first stable 
release of the EmuLinker Kaillera Server.  Thanks to everyone that has reported 
bugs and made suggestions over the last year!  This will likely be the last 
update release for quite a while if not ever.

Bug Fixes Only

- Fixed duplicate user/game problem during login
- Numerous other minor bug fixes

0.99.24 (04/03/2006)
====================

New Features

- Support for domain names in access.cfg; allows easier configuration for people 
  without a static ip address
- New admin command /clear to remove temp bans
- New Autofire Detector feature can alert players about possible cheating

Bug Fixes

- Server startup .bat file in last release was mistakenly pre-configured for JRockit
- Language file was not discovered properly for non-english locales
- Fixed minor player state bug

0.99.17 (02/17/2006)
====================

New Features

- Support for international languages and customized prompts
- New online admin commands including /closegame and /version
- Improved game desynch handling

Bug Fixes

- Fixed thread deadlock issues that caused previous version to lockup occasionally
- Server status is now sent in multiple packets, fixing the inherent Kaillera 
  protocol bug that caused login problems for some users.
- Fixed vulnerability where a specially constructed packet would leave a ghost 
  game on the server, eventually resulting in a denial of service
- Fixed bug causing packets with less than 3 messages to be marked as 3
- Various other minor bug fixes and tweaks

0.98.5 (10/30/2005)
===================

Bug Fixes Only

- Doubled default V086Controller buffer size to 8192; 4096 was too small for
  servers with more than approximately 75 users online.
- Fixed multiple places where thread deadlock could occur and cause server
  lockup, although the possibility was very rare.

0.98.2 (10/22/2005)
===================

New Features

- Noticably reduced game play delay and lagginess as a result of better network 
  packet handling code.
  
Bug Fixes

- Fixed occasional lockup in 0.97.6 during heavy load caused by thread deadlock.
- Fixed message count bug in 0.97.6.  Packets were always marked as size 18.

0.97.6 (10/14/2005)
===================

New Features

- Reduced game play delay and lagginess as a result of new more efficient 
  game data passing algorithms.
- Eliminated emulator lockup issues when the game starter closes the game 
  abruptly and others are still playing.
- Improved multiplayer handling for 3 or more players.  Games no longer 
  desynch when one player leaves but others are still playing.
- Games now remember users that were kicked and will not allow rejoining.
- Added MaxGames parameter to help control bandwidth usage.
- Changed allowed Connection Types so server owners can disable 1 or more 
  specific connection types instead of just setting a max.
- Server owners can now run servers that allow only specific games or emulators 
  using the new access manager's game and emulator filters.
- New access manager allows server owners to assign 3 separate user access 
  levels: normal, elevated, and admin.  Elevated level users have fewer 
  restrictions and the ability to join a full server.  Admin users 
  additionally have access to special server control commands such as: /kick, 
  /ban, /silence, /announce, etc.
- Server uses a configurable limited range of ports instead of any available 
  port on the machine, making firewall configuration easier and more secure.
- Configuration files are now standard name=value properties files instead of 
  XML, to make configuration less error-prone.

Bug Fixes

- Fixed "Too Many Open Files" bug in version 0.96 caused by the master server 
  list updater leaving sockets open.

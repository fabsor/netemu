<h2>Basic usage</h2>
<p>Context allows you to manage contextual conditions and reactions for different portions of your site. You can think of each context as representing a 'section' of your site. For each context, you can choose the conditions that trigger this context to be active and choose different aspects of Drupal that should respond to this active context. </p>

<p>Think of conditions as a set of rules that are checked during page load to see what context is active. Any reactions that are associated with active contexts are then fired.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>You want to create a 'pressroom' section of your site. You have a press room view that displays press release nodes, but you also want to tie a book with media resources tightly to this section. You would also like a contact block you've made to appear whenever a user is in the
pressroom section.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a new context on admin/build/context.</li>
<li>Set the value to 'pressroom'</li>
<li>In the '<em>Conditions</em>' section, associate the pressroom nodetype, the pressroom view, and the media kit book with the context.</li>
<li>Choose the pressroom menu item to be set active in the '<em>Reactions</em>' section.</li>
<li>Add the contact block to a region under the block visibility settings, at the bottom of the '<em>Reactions</em>' section.</li>
<li>Save the context.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use the '<em>sitewide</em>' context condition to ensure that a context is active on any page of you site.</p>
<p>Further, you can use the fact the each context is evaluated in turn to provide a 'default' context within every namespace/attribute pair.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Let's suppose that you have a block that you want to show on every page of your site, except in the 'news' section. Here's how you could do that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create your first, sitewide, context, set it using the sitewide context and select the block that you would like to show using the reactions section.</li>
  <li>Make a note of the value of this context with the chosen namespace and attribute.</li>
  <li>Create your second context, use exactly the same namespace and attribute as the first, but make sure the value comes after alphabetically.</li>
  <li>Set up your second context with the conditions that define your 'news' section.</li>
  <li>Set up the reactions to be the same as your first context, but <em>without</em> the block that you don't want to appear.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! Context should evaluate your contexts and if the 'news' context's conditions are met the blocks it defines for that namespace and attribute will be used instead of the defaults.</p>
